Given the population and growing rate of 2 cities (A and B), she would like to know how many years would be necessary to the smaller city (always A) to be greater than the larger city (always B) in population. Of course, she only wants to know the result for cities that the growing rate for city A is bigger than the growing rate for city B, therefore, she separated these test cases for you. Your job is to build a program that print the time in years for each test case.\n",
