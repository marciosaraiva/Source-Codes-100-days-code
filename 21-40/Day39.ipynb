Meanwhile every other crow is flying collecting entries for the lottery, the three-eyed crow already knows the results, and when Bran dreams with the three-eyed crow, the crow tells him the result. Bran always remember these dreams very well, however, he can't understand them fast enough to know the result. Your task is write a program to calculate the result from Bran's dream.\n",

    "Every blink of the crow communicates a binary number. An open eye means 1 and a closed eye means 0. The left eye is the most significative eye and the right eye is the least significative eye. Every blink this number is added and when the crow screams, the sum is a result.\n",

In order to make this School happen, many have worked, whether in writing the problems, in configuring the Portal, in making the arrengements for the event or in raising the funds. Our special acknowledgement this year goes to Professor Ricardo Oliveira, who has not only accepted our invitation to come and teach the workshops but has also been participating on the organisation of this School. We are sure that his experience and his career at ICPC as contestant and as coach have motived and inspired us all.\n",

Here, in Beyond the Wall, programming is also fun. Keep studying, keep training, and more and more. What is important is the path you choose to pursue from now on. Our advice is that you should always enjoy every single moment, every workshop, every school, every training session, every time practicing or studying at home. Our days are never coming back.\n",
