    "Every year after the contest that takes place in Taxiland, contestants and coaches go to the famous and renowned restaurant Radar. However, the waiters (always very kind and polite) get overwhelmed due to the amount of people, and therefore, end up taking a while to serve them.\n",

    "Contestants or coaches who sit at the ends are the lucky ones, because they order only once and are served right away, but the others must always order twice, because the waiters (always very kind and polite) are careless and easily forget the orders. Besides, there's a superstition going on among the contestants and coaches that if there's not an even amount of people who don't sit at the ends, none of the university's teams will win the next contest.\n",

They also measured the time down a key, which was exactly 1/100 second. The challenge would be who typed the word \"Galopeira\" consisting of letters and more, but both were very good, and arrived at a point that it was not possible to count how many letters had been typed.
