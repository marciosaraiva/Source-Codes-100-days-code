    "Hyam is a guy that loves sequences. He is finding interesting sequences that even Fibonacci would not have imagined. One day Hyam saw that given a number N, he could make a sequence like 0 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 …N N N … N. However, Hyam saw that each value that increased in the sequence number, the total quantity increases at a factorial rate. In this case, instead of multiplying, you add the total number of numbers to the sequence with the value of the next number in the sequence. For example, if N = 2. The correct sequence would be 0 1 2 2, which is 4 digits. Now, if N = 3, the next number in the sequence would have the value 3, so the total quantity of numbers in the sequence would bem the quantiy of numbers with N = 2, which is 4, plus the value of the next number in the sequence, in this case 3, giving you 7, since the correct sequence for N = 3 is 0 1 2 2 3 3 3.\n",
