So many past events and professor MC was curious about what year each of these have happened.\n",

    "Welcome to the 3rd UFFS Junior Programming Contest. We sincerely hope the next hours are very productive to you, you get many balloons and, above all, you have fun! Remember that you can ask for a clarification whenever you are not sure that you understand a problem description. Remember also that at 17.30 the automatic judges will be turned off and the competition will enter blind mode, so that all submissions made during this period will begin to be judged only at 18.10. Please stay with us till the end of the competition, working on solutions for the problems till the last minute, because, as long as the contest is running, there is still hope!\n",

    "And it was hope that motivated Grandma Zazá, a 72-year-old lady, to fulfill her dream of starting an undergraduate course. She is fascinated by everything related to the University: the classes, the library, the research and extension projects, the refectory, but especially the student card that she can use to get 50% off cinema tickets. Last week Grandma Zazá and her colleagues went to the cinema to watch a movie, but they were appalled at the ticket price increase. Disgusted, they decided to make a protest, scheduled for tomorrow at General Bertaso Square, against the oppressive capitalist system. Grandma Zazá wants to collaborate with the movement by making a poster with the following watchword:\n",

The first farm of the sequence was named Star 1, the second Star 2, and so on. However, the brother who lives in Star 1 has got mad and decided to make a Star Trek in order to steal sheep from the proprieties of his siblings. But he is definitely crazy. When passes by the farm Star i, he steals only one sheep (if there is any) from that farm and moves on either to Star i + 1 or Star i - 1, depending on whether the number of sheep in Star i was, respectively, odd or even. If there is not the Star to which he wants to go, he halts his trek. The mad brother starts his Star Trek in Star 1, stealing a sheep from his own farm.\n",
